Task-2:


Project Title: Tic Tac Toe Game

Project Description:
The "Tic Tac Toe Game" project is a Python-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. This project allows users to play Tic Tac Toe in two modes: against a computer bot or between two human players.

Features:

Main Menu: The project begins with a user-friendly main menu that offers two gameplay options:

Play against Bot: In this mode, the user can play against a computer-controlled bot that makes random moves.
Play between two Players: This mode allows two human players to take turns playing against each other on the same computer.
Game Board: A 3x3 game board is displayed on the screen, showing the current state of the game with 'X' and 'O' symbols.

Input Validation: The program validates user inputs to ensure that they are within the valid range (1-9) and that the selected position is unoccupied.

Win Detection: The game checks for winning conditions after each move, including horizontal, vertical, and diagonal alignments of 'X' or 'O' symbols. When a win is detected, the game announces the winner.

Tie Detection: The game checks for a tie (a full board with no winner) and declares it when appropriate.

Random Bot Moves: In the "Play against Bot" mode, the computer bot makes random moves, providing a basic but challenging opponent.

Project Benefits:

Provides an enjoyable and interactive gaming experience for users.
Offers the choice between playing against a computer bot or with friends.
Demonstrates input validation techniques.
Implements logic for win and tie conditions, enhancing problem-solving skills.
Enhances programming skills through Python development.
Serves as a fun and educational coding project for beginners and intermediate-level programmers.
Instructions for Use:

Run the Python program in a compatible environment.
Choose between playing against a bot or between two players from the main menu.
Follow the on-screen prompts to make moves (input positions in the range 1-9) and enjoy the game.
The game will announce the winner or declare a tie when the game concludes.
